# Hemi-Lab Ultra

Hemi-Lab Ultra is a lightweight browser application for exploring altered states of consciousness. The project contains a single HTML file with an audio engine and optional static server.

## Why
This project draws inspiration from the Monroe Institute's decades of
brainwave-entrainment research and the U.S. Army's interest in those
methods, revealed in declassified CIA "Gateway Process" documents. The
institute pioneered the Hemi-Sync approach to stimulate left/right brain
coherence and facilitate deep meditative states. Government analysts
later examined the techniques for potential applications in remote
viewing and psychological operations. Hemi-Lab Ultra explores similar
concepts in an open-source context so individuals can experiment with
these audio patterns themselves. The project has no affiliation with the
Monroe Institute or any government agency.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser; or
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`, run `node server.js` and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for a local server.

## EEG Bridge
A Python script for streaming OpenBCI EEG data is available in `python/eeg_bridge.py`.
It broadcasts realâ€‘time band power metrics over a WebSocket server.

### Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pyOpenBCI numpy scipy websockets
   ```
2. Connect your board and run:
   ```bash
   python python/eeg_bridge.py
   ```
3. Listen on `ws://localhost:3000` for JSON data (adjust `ws_port` in the script if needed).

## Features
- **Binaural Beat Engine** â€“ custom frequency entrainment with phase shifting and comprehensive error handling
- **Focus Level Navigator** â€“ Monroe Institute inspired presets
- **REBAL Energy Shield** â€“ animated protection visualization
- **GPU-Accelerated Visuals** â€“ smoother REBAL animation using CSS transforms
- **Breath Coach** â€“ synchronized breathing prompts
- **Session Journal** â€“ record mood and insights
- **Pattern Analysis** â€“ discover optimal practice trends
- **Affirmation Layer** â€“ spoken positive cues during sessions
- **Smooth Frequency Ramps** â€“ crackle-free adjustments when changing tones
- **Data Import/Export** â€“ backup and restore your journal history
- **Real-Time EEG Feedback** â€“ optional audio adjustments via WebSocket
- **Session Composer** â€“ layer multiple sound tracks
- **Advanced Breath Patterns** â€“ choose box, 4-7-8 or Wim Hof styles
- **Contact Mode Triggers** â€“ probabilistic deep-state events
- **AI Journal Analysis** â€“ automatic insight summaries
- **Analytics Dashboard** â€“ visual focus statistics
- **Secure User Accounts** â€“ bcrypt password hashing, token-based authentication, rate limiting
- **Cloud Sync** â€“ store sessions securely with per-user access control
- **Group Session Rooms** â€“ synchronized multi-user experiences
- **Wearable Sensor Support** â€“ heart rate and GSR input for biofeedback
- **VR/AR Visualization Mode** â€“ immersive environment via WebXR
- **Offline PWA** â€“ installable app with cached sessions

## Usage
1. Select your desired focus level.
2. Adjust base/beat frequencies, phase and volume.
3. Click **Begin Session** to start audio and visuals.
4. Optionally enable the REBAL shield or breath coach.
5. After stopping, write down your experience in the journal.
6. Click **Analyze Patterns** in the journal section to review insights.

The deeper states (Focus 15, 21, 23+) can produce profound results. Use quality headphones in a quiet space and document everything.

## API Authentication

When using the backend server, all session endpoints require authentication:

1. **Register** a new account (minimum 8 character password):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"your_user","password":"your_password"}'
   ```

2. **Login** to receive a token (valid for 24 hours):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"your_user","password":"your_password"}'
   ```

3. **Use the token** in subsequent requests:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sessions \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
     -d '{"focus":10,"duration":600}'
   ```

**Security Features:**
- bcrypt password hashing with 12 salt rounds
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per 15 minutes on auth endpoints
- Token-based authentication with 24-hour expiry
- Users can only access their own session data
